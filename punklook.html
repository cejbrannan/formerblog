          <p>Jean on jean is back baby! Debbie Harry, one of the punk icons, may pull off jean on jean better than anyone. Here she has the classic Levi 505's, now it's pretty difficult to find them in women's sizes but I believe Kohl's has some. The straight cut and thick material is pretty sick if you ask me.</p>

          <p>For a your classic biker jacket, while they're definitely back in style and easy to find, there comes a dilemma when picking one out. "Vegan" aka fake leather, is pure plastic, obviously pretty bad for the environment but cow skin isn't very ethical either. I recommend going to a thrift store to find the perfect one (or three if you're like me) because you want an authentic jacket without contributing to animal abuse or pollution. Another great thing about leather jackets, they're totally androgynous.</p>

          <p>The punk shag or mullet is a classic hairstyle. Super easy to style given its messy nature.</p>

          <p>The jean jacket with patches is one of my go-tos. I've been collecting patches from wherever the hell I can find them and stitching them on as time goes by, but this can actually be a really cheap way to show off punk personality. You can order patches on-line, and while I recommend sewing them on it's really easy to iron them on too.</p>
