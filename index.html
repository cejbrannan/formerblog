    <!-- <h2>Being Queer is Punk Rock</h2>
    <h4>3/21/2022</h4>
    <p>&emsp; I'm a big believer that punk is a rejection of institutionalized beliefs. Punk to me is a form of self expression that allows me to vent my frustrations with the world and with myself in a way that is constructive rather than destructive. My
      story of queerness comes from a lot of religious trauma and mommy and daddy issues, if that's not what you're here to read about, please carry on. But my story of queerness doesn't end with a big coming out story, it continues with self
      acceptance through the punk movement, a movement that says "fuck the world, I am who I am".</p>
    <p>&emsp; I was raised Catholic. You already know we're in the shit here. My mom was catholic and my dad wasn't, so it was a source of a lot of tension at home. My mom wanted my dad to convert, and my dad wanted my mom to fuck off and mind her own
      business. They had agreed when they got married to raise their children Catholic, so despite my dad's issues with Catholicism (which largely were rooted in a belief that Mary doesn't deserve to be worshipped, so sexism), my brother and I grew
      up attending Catholic school. I believed from a young age that I had a special connection with god, mainly because my mom had a fever dream when she was pregnant with me that she met Mary so she raised me to think I was the next Saint of
      whatever the fuck. Catholicism taught me a skewed view of right and wrong, it taught me several harmless identities were wrong, for example, queerness. But queerness isn't really a harmless identity, it's a threat to the white supremacist,
      patriarchal, capitalistic pillars that hold up our completely fucked society.</p>
    <p>&emsp; I remember asking my mom what 'gay' meant in 5th grade, because I was completely sheltered and had no idea. She told me it was something bad that we would talk about when I was older. I eventually learned what gay meant and ended up
      internalizing that gayness was a sin on par with murder. This wasn't really a problem until I got a few years older and we had our sex education. I remember being confused why I wasn't obsessed with boys the way other girls were, and being
      obsessed instead with female singers and a few girls in my class. Going to an all girls school meant constant rumors about who might be a lesbian, and I wasn't really on the radar until I made the awesome decision to get a pixie cut. I knew I
      had felt something for girls, but I just pushed it down for as long as I could. I was rumored to be a lesbian but I knew I was not a lesbian.</p>
    <p>&emsp; After years of denial, I finally was forced to accept the feelings I had towards girls. I had spent years hating myself, and my first step to acceptance was telling some people around me. I told friends, lost quite a few in the process,
      accidentally outed myself to my parents and got grounded and sent to a Catholic therapist. The details aren't important.</p>
    <p>Even after I had come out I was far from accepting my sexuality. It wasn't until I really started listening to queer music that I made any steps towards self love. The thing is, queerness in the music scene kind of started with the origins
      of rock. Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the mother, the creator, of rock and roll was a queer black female musician in the 40s. Until the 70s, any queer songs were rewritten to heterosexual pronouns. Starting with some women covering songs done by
      famous male artists, people started to leave pronouns as they were written regardless of gender. For instance, Suzi Quatro's cover of I Wanna Be Your Man. Finding Suzi Quatro and listening to her music full of gender fluidity got me excited
      to be queer for the first time after years of being out. Then I listened to songs like AC-DC by the Sweet, finding myself again proud of my sexuality and identity.</p>
    <p>&emsp; The thing is, being queer still wasn't ok in the music industry in the 70s. Suzi Quatro's queer songs never became popular, and her career died out without proper recognition. The Sweet's most popular songs never mentioned gender or
      sexuality, and glam rock was skinned, gutted, and stuffed with heteronormativity. Then came punk rock. Many people see punk as a rejection of glam and glitter, but punk was just another side. It's like musicians had gotten fed up having their
      songs straightened out and said "fuck the producers, we're gonna do our thing". In the punk scene fluidity was not only accepted, it was encouraged. Aggressions towards oppressive structures were screamed into a microphone and people started
      to listen. It spoke to the silent majority, the people who didn't fit into a cookie cutter nuclear family life. This included all the fuck up kids, the social rejects, the people of color, and the queers. There was a unity in this group of
      people who had been told who they were wasn't good enough, and that's where I found my place. </p>
    <p>&emsp; Look at Iggy Pop, Jaynes County, and countless other classic CBGB bands. Queerness was cool. It was front and center and once that happened, there was no taking it back. Musicians could fully express themselves in this one genre. When they
      could express themselves, people came to listen. There's something cathartic about seeing a person be themselves truly, against every odd and oppressor. People were addicted to the expression, in the form of both fans and bands. </p>
    <p>&emsp; I see punk rock as an opening of the floodgates that allowed musicians to truly be themselves. I was able to accept myself only when I fully rejected the forces that brought me up. It's scary to throw away the only life you've known, but in
      order to know and love yourself, you have to get rid of what you've been taught. There's a true internal acceptance that comes with rejection of external norms. For me this was Catholicism and a happy nuclear family. All I had known was
      killing me inside. I rejected what I knew and accepted the unknown, punk. I think every out musician or music lover has been directly affected by punk rock. In a genre that rejects society and encourages self acceptance, heteronormativity has
      keeled over and taken its last breath.</p>

    <h2>Liz Phair: Exile in Guyville</h2>
    <h4>3/20/2022</h4>
    <p>&emsp; Liz Phair has been around for a while but her most important album, in my opinion, is Exile in Guyville. She took each song off Exile on Main St. by the Rolling Stones and wrote a feminist critique of every single one. I personally
      had nothing against the Rolling Stones until I listened to these albums one song at a time. Rocks off followed by 6'1", Rip this Joint followed by Help me Mary, etc. It speaks to how ingrained sexism is in our world that I, an infamous
      feminist killjoy, was able to listen to these songs by the stones for years and have no issue until someone else pointed out the blatant misogyny. </p>
    <p>&emsp; Starting with Rocks Off and 6'1", Liz Phair calls out the stones in a satirical manner, "I bet you fall in bed too easily with the beautiful girls who are shyly brave". The Rolling Stones sell themselves as these men who were born to
      have it all, they didn't chose the rock n roll life, rock chose them so-to-speak. The stones sing about how badass they are for not conforming, but Phair mentions that when women do it we are viewed as lost causes. Non-conforming men are
      rockstars, non-conforming women are worthless. Men are allowed in our world to take and abuse while women are expected to clean up men's messes and wait our turn. In order to simply carry on with an out of the ordinary life, as women we have
      to pretend to stand tall like a man, for example, 6'1" instead of 5'2". The rocks off mentality is a toxic one, in fact, the entire discography of the Rolling Stones is toxic. If you meet someone who really relates to their lyrics, just
      fucking run. The stones embody men not taking responsibility for their actions and attributing every mistake they make to their testosterone. Which brings me to Fuck and Run.</p>
    <p>&emsp; In their song "Happy", the stones say they could only ever be happy with a series of one night stands, no commitment, no strings attached. Phair sings the song "Fuck and Run" expressing the basic human desire for a connection beyond
      sex, something that no one should be shamed for regardless of gender. It is natural to want someone to take an interest in you, it is natural to want your partners to care about you beyond just your body. Commitment and genuine desire beyond
      physical form are normal things; if you don't want them, great, if you do, great too. (Speaking in terms of heteronormativity) Women are often shamed more than men for not wanting to be left high and dry; women are compared to a ball and
      chain for not wanting to be single mothers. This is because women so often have to clean up men's messes and want a sign they won't be in it alone. This is not a crazy thing to ask. A boyfriend, a husband, a life partner, that is a normal
      thing to want. But women get called crazy for asking for a form of commitment. Phair says stop with the fuck and run, just be upfront and responsible and it can be a much more leisurely fuck and walk when both parties agree.</p>
    <p>&emsp; Phair's most powerful imagery comes in the form of her song "Glory", her take on "Shake Your Hips". Quite literally a song telling women to shut up and use their bodies, once again showing all the stones value in a woman is their
      body. To the Rolling Stones, a woman may as well be a sex doll.</p>
    <p>&emsp; Lastly, I want to talk about the song Sweet Virginia. Ok, maybe women are more than sex dolls to the stones, they're sex dolls with something to be won. That's right, virginity. To the stones, women are meant to be manipulated into
      sex, like lambs to the slaughter. First of all, why the fuck can't a man enjoy a woman who is sexually liberated, why do they always have to get off on some sort of daddy issue or catholic repression? Second of all, what is with the obsession
      with virginity? That's just rape culture in action. The idea that men are taking something from a woman, that they were the first man to have a woman, that they even have a woman at all. I'll say it once, breaking a hymen does not make you
      special. If that were the case there would be a whole lot of special bicycles. Phair was justified in writing Soap Star Joe; men often just wanna be a hero until the shit hits the fan. </p>
    <p>&emsp; Liz Phair is a musical legend but this album does what many not only were afraid of, but never thought of. Calling out the Rolling Stones is a huge mission, one that would likely send your career into a downward spiral given all their
      thoughtless fans. Anyways, I highly recommend you listen to the songs in order, it will honestly change how you view classic rock, but be prepared to have the songs you knew as dad rock turned sour.</p>

    <h2>WTF is Poly Styrene</h2>
    <h4>2/10/2022</h4>
    <p>%emsp; If you're on here I probably don't have to tell you who Poly Styrene is, but in the hopes I blow up and some random people who have never heard of X-ray Spex come across this, I'll tell you. Poly Styrene is to female punk what Kathleen Hanna is to riot grrrl. A foundation. One would not exist without the other. Poly Styrene was a british musician (no I won't capitalize british I don't respect them) who was well over 20 years ahead of her time. Listen to her only album Germ Free Adolescents, no longer streaming in the United States, and then listen to a riot grrrl playlist of your choosing. The sarcasm, the satire, and the irony in embracing what everyone tells you to be ashamed of, these concepts are nearly identical. Her most famous song "Oh Bondage, Up Yours!", Styrene sings the premise of "Rape Me" by Nirvana as a 21 year old black woman in the seventies. "I wanna be a victim to you all" she shrieks. Some audiences think it's about kink, but to me it's more than that. It's about shock factor; this woman who at the time is ranked in the bottom of Eurocentric society is telling people to beat her up. She is taking the fact that people hurl her to the ground in life and giving it a masochistic twist. To me, Styrene is saying hurt me all you want, I love the pain.
    </p><p>
      &emsp; I am a poseur pulls to surface how women and minorities often aren't credited for their cultural contributions. It's a double entendre: Styrene is a poseur for dressing and acting out of the ordinary, just seeking attention, and she is a poseur for suggesting that she's a total cultural revolution. Today we use poser to  describe somebody trying to fit into a crowd they don't really belong to, but it also means somebody trying their hardest to stand out. Poly Styrene deconstructs the meaning of the word poser (or poseur) by comparing how she's called a poser for standing out and a poser for trying to fit in. Styrene brings to light the reality that no matter what she does as a black daughter of immigrants, people will tell her she doesn't fit. Poser means she is simultaneously too much, and not enough.
    </p><p>
      &emsp; The last song I'll talk about (for now) is the title song of her legendary album. Germ Free Adolescents is particularly fitting to my life right now. Keep in mind it's all satirical. I'm at a point where quite honestly, I'm a fucking mess in every sense of the word. We put this pressure on cleanliness, neatness, and togetherness that takes a major toll to those who can't convince themselves to fake it. I don't believe anyone is really together; I think every single person on earth is kind of a walking shit show whether it's covered by a $3000 designer suit or a flannel stolen from Savers. Why as a 20 year old am I supposed to be put together? My prefrontal cortex isn't developed, the government doesn't trust me with alcohol (rightfully so) and neither do my parents. There isn't a law in science or court suggesting I should have myself together, yet there is a cultural undertone that if I'm not level headed and looking "clean", I am worth less than someone who dresses and speaks differently. I am not germ free. "Scrub away" in Styrene's song isn't a good thing; if I scrub away at all the dirt that's supposed to be there, the tendency to blackout, the slightly crooked tattoos, the eyeliner that isn't quite aligned, I end up scrubbing away my personality. To be a germ free adolescent means to be one of the crowd, someone devoid of  individuality.
    </p><p>
      &emsp; Poly Styrene was ahead of her time and underappreciated. She satirized concepts that had yet to be second guessed. Dressed like an alien, singing like a girl, and dancing like a freak, Poly Styrene was a revolution and a defining factor in all punk. Whether the punks who came after her realize it or not, Styrene was a cornerstone of their genre, but still is swept under the rug.

    <!-- <h2>Complacency</h2>
    <h4>5/20/2020</h4>
    <p>&emsp; In these past weeks of quarantine the one thing that really comes to mind is something my dad always says; "humans can adapt to anything". And it's true. We get used to things, we grow at ease with our current state of being and we stop fighting. We start learning how to roll over and take it. There's a normal in our world and while we may not like it, and talk about how annoying it is, we keep just letting it get by, for our own benefit. I know I have spent most of my life doing this. Mainly because as a child we don't know any better. We grow up being fed information from whichever adults surround us most, which typically is our parents. They teach us what's acceptable and they teach us what to hate. I was taught to hate disorder; if things were messy I had to fix them, and what do you know, now I deeply and anxiously analyze the cleanliness of every fucking room I walk into. </p>
    <p>&emsp; We grow up being taught to like certain things about ourselves and to hate certain things about others, and forming the mind of a child is simply about convincing the kid that they can be all the things you like about people. It doesn't work. </p>
    <p>$emsp; My mom's favorite type of woman is a soft-spoken one. This is the highest compliment she can bestow upon any woman, the best trait a woman can have, and while she raised me teaching me soft spoken was good I still grew up to be one of the loudest bitches out there. I'm known with my friends for my lack of passive-aggressiveness, because if I have a problem I just say it. </p>
    <p>So here's my problem</p>
    <p>&emsp; I keep seeing these posts on instagram about wanting to rebel as a generation with like 4 million likes, with comments and well written arguments about how fed up our generation is with some of these social norms. Yet, nothing changes. I think we're taught to be complacent, to be patient and wait our turns, to make slow change if we want it but guess what, the biggest political movements haven't exactly happened because people kept hoping and praying the government would change its mind. People went out and did something. </p>
    <p>&emsp; Now I'm definitely not saying start some violent protest that leads to injuries or death, but goddamn start some protest. If you're not in the protesting mood, stop rolling over and taking some of the shit people are giving you. I could punch myself for all the times I said nothing when someone was homophobic, racist, sexist, xenophobic, and so on. We keep to ourselves as to not disrupt the calm but guess what bitches: entropy is what. Everything in the universe eventually moves into chaos and disorder, so stop sitting back just to keep the peace. Call out your friends, relatives, strangers, when they do something you think is fucked up. Post something about a government conspiracy or a corporation using sweatshops. Stop being concerned that your expression will bother people. STOP BEING AFRAID TO DISRUPT WHAT'S ACCEPTED.</p>

    <h2>Modern Music isn't Soulless, You Are</h2>
    <h4>4/12/20</h4>
    <p>&emsp; Before anyone starts listing out examples of modern music that’s relevant and important, I’m not saying “all modern music”. But as I sit here looking at the billboard top 100 for this week, I’m having a hard time finding a single lyric that means anything to me personally. </p>
    <p>&emsp; Now, a lot of the top music is rap. And No Fucking Way am I about to say that rap is pointless, or garbage, or other things white boys with an ego who worship the Red Hot Chilli Peppers would say. Rap was, and in several cases still is, an honest articulation of the struggle black people have to face in our country, an expression of class, race, gender, and unfair expectations. But the rap music that remains on our top charts, is quite simply, white kid party music. The songs that become popular are the songs that suburban kids like to get down to, the ones white kids like to dance to and whatever makes them feel like a gangster as they cruise around in the acura daddy bought them. Not to call names, but Roxanne? All she wanna do is party all night? What the hell does that mean? Why would I listen if I'm not wasted?</p>
    <p>&emsp; Don’t get me wrong, I like to dance to songs with a rhythm, but music to me is beyond just a beat to throw your ass back to when crossed. I think there’s a time and place for this party music, but what about driving around on your own? I want songs that make me angry, upset, or songs that seem so honest it feels like they were written about me personally. I want songs with thought and music I can relate to. Music that teaches me something. This doesn’t exclude music written by people of color, it means dive fucking deeper into the albums of your favorite artists. They probably have something deeper to say than let me see that ass bounce at some point. Listen to what people are saying. It’s like the “This is America” music video. White kids honest to god cheer and gleefully sing along to songs talking about the brutal murders of black kids and class division. I in no way want to belittle music written by artists of color. We need carefree songs for partying, we need fun songs, but white kids, don’t stop there. Listen to Kendrick Lamar, Lizzo, even (old) Kanye, and actually think about what you're hearing.
    </p>

    <!-- <h2>When to Stop Rebelling</h2>
    <h4>4/12/2020</h4>
    <p>&emsp; So, if you’ve read my previous articles or are familiar with the origins of punk, you’ll know that this movement is about kids wanting to do something wrong. In the original CBGB scene, many influencers would do and say anything offensive, upsetting, and unusual. This was to make a statement about the world in which these kids were living, a way to say “things aren’t fucking perfect and we know it”. </p>
    <p>&emsp; The real point of the punk angst was to remind people the reality of their beings, that they did drugs, had raunchy sex, and had dirtier lives than the music industry was recognizing. In 1978 the billboard top songs included “Summer Nights”, “Shadow Dancing”, and “Use Ta Be My Girl”. Punk was meant to call bullshit on such songs. Bee bop love songs didn’t define their generation, but they were still the hits.</p>
    <p>&emsp; However, some of the angst and rebellion was taken too far. For example the Dead Boys at one point put swastika stickers on their equipment. This so-called “act of rebellion” was an ignorant statement, it was meant to rile people up and remind everyone that they won’t conform to society. Patti Smith sang a song Rock n Roll N****r. If you’ve ever seen Patti Smith, she’s not black, I believe she sang this because she wanted to upset people. But for the love of God, upset people over something that’s actually wrong. Another rebellion and act of aggression taken beyond the purpose of punk.</p>
    <p>&emsp; There’s a difference between good rebellion and bad rebellion. There are some things the world deems socially unacceptable and for a good reason. Swastikas and white people saying the N word are pretty good examples. What many punk bands didn’t understand is that just because something is unacceptable doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be. Society has a few things right, and while we have a “fuck society” mentality, this frustration needs to be focused on real problems.</p>
    <p>&emsp; If we hope to bring punk to our generation, we need to understand that we are against double standards and fucked up ideals, not society as a whole. Get mad about incarceration rates of black men compared to white men for the same crime, get mad that women in Alabama can’t get abortions, get mad that men are told to be perfectly masculine and that conversion therapy is totally ok in most states. There’s a whole lot of shit the world throws at us, and being fed up with it is what draws us to the punk movement. However, doing everything deemed unacceptable is not a solution. Call people to action, spread awareness, get angry about injustice, but don’t play into fucking up the few things the world has been progressive about.</p>
    <hr /> -->
    <h2>Why Women Rule Punk</h2>
    <h4>4/2/2020</h4>
    <p>&emsp; Hopefully if you’re on this page, you have a bit of an idea of what it means to be punk. From Blondie, Patti Smith, Bikini Kill, and many others I hope to credit in later articles, there has been a long line of women who run what we consider to be punk music. </p>
    <p>&emsp; For whatever reason *cough* sexism *cough*, punk history does not quite credit women like it should. Blondie was vital to the punk movement; led by a blonde who was credited only as a sex symbol rather than a revolutionary, the band brought underground rock to the average person; they bridged the gap between pop and punk.</p>
    <p>&emsp; Now a lot of people think punk has disappeared, but it's way more common than you know. The typical theme in punk is honesty and rebellion against the status quo. Punk started because the kids of New York were upset about the world around them, upset they couldn’t express themselves honestly, upset they couldn’t speak about the bad emotions in the time of disco, funk, and feel good music. This is still a theme in music, but it’s now found under female songwriters.</p>
    <p>&emsp; Women on the daily face way more absurd expectations than men. Despite the increase in civil rights, I, an engineering major, still am consistently asked if I went to college for my Mrs. degree or to join a sorority. Bullshit. No one has ever asked my brother this, no one has asked my brother when he wants to get married, in fact, people don’t bring up marriage when talking about a guy’s future. Sure, I have a lot more rights than the average woman in 1975, but god I still have to put up with a lot of bullshit.</p>
    <p>&emsp; In my effort to not be narrow-minded, I realize that as a white American woman expectations and rights are way more available to me than women of other races, classes, or nationalities. However, this gap in gender is shared to some extent among all women. And it makes us fucking riot. Punk is about rebellion, it’s about fighting for freedom and self expression of sex and happiness and hate. Men are allowed to express these emotions in a way women aren’t, creating the punk culture in young women today.</p>
    <p>&emsp; My current favorite punk bands are mostly female led: Destroy Boys, GRLwood, childbirth, Slutever, and so on. There is a message in punk that only women are singing about and only women are receiving. Men still consider female-led rock bands as a separate division, a subcategory of rock. I’ve talked to tons of guys who refer to Paramore and any female led punk band as “girl rock”. Yeah, it’s sung by a fucking girl but it’s still punk. Men are less willing to listen to women complain about their worlds so they discredit them, allowing subpar men to take credit for movements started by women. My prediction is that in a few years some male led punk bands will become popular by voicing the same message as the ones female led punk bands have been for decades.</p>
    <p>&emsp; I have no clue what I’m supposed to do about this so I don’t have much advice to give. I’ll say, girls, keep being that punk chick. If a guy calls you edgy but listens to Green Day or the Clash, he’s just upset a woman has more of a personality than him. Guys, stop calling girls edgy and being intimidated by outspoken women. Listen to “girl rock” and realize the message quite possibly applies to you. We need to start having a conversation about rebellion in women versus men and punk culture is a shining example.</p>

    <h2>New Punk</h2>
    <h4>4/2/2020</h4>
    <p>&emsp; Punk seems to be this idea of late 70s early 80s angst pent up and melted down to a liquid form for the teen going through their rebellious phase to shoot up. Originating in some rank New York bar, punk, aka underground rock, was a voice against society, complacency, and a brutally honest explanation of the world as it is. New York in the 70s was quite honestly a shit show; the city was dirty, violent, and drug addicted during the time of the Bee Gees and Grease's You're the One that I Want.  Pop music was ignorant and inaccurate. From Television’s Marquee Moon to the Tuff Darts singing “I’m sick of all the  crap I gotta take in this town, if I didn’t know that I’d sweat I’d burn it to the ground” punk was something rebellious, big, and incredible. So where is it now?</p>
    <p>&emsp; Some of the problem seems to be that teens just aren’t as angsty. Being nineteen and from the Midwest, I’ve found that a lot of people are pretty upset when you voice  that you think there’s something wrong with your world. I’m not gonna lie, I have it good. My parents made money so that I could go to school like them, get a job like them, and I never have worried once in my life that I would go hungry. But this cookie cutter ideal life with fairly loving and somewhat accepting parents makes me feel like I’m missing something. In the words of Voltaire, “the biggest mistake in life is to live without living”. And I don’t feel like I’m living.</p>
    <p>&emsp; As much as most teenagers lives today in America, especially those from a suburban white family, seem to be functional and perfect, I think my generation has a sense of a hole. Maybe not all of us, but I think there’s something unfulfilling about my life, about our lives. I talked to my friends about this and they all know exactly what I mean. I recognize that this problem comes from a place of privilege, and my mom suggests that I’ll find my purpose through volunteering with a bunch of cookie-cutter Christian teens through the local church’s youth group. Helping people is good, help people any way you can, and I don't claim to have a solution figured out. Maybe it’s my teen angst or girly hormones or history of depression but I want more from life than what I’m living. So I pick punk.</p>
    <p>&emsp; To me, punk is about going against everything that’s expected. It’s creating your own path and finding your brand and being able to stare someone in the eyes without giving a damn. The cattiness I was raised on has no place in punk. If I’m angry I’ll say it, if I’m sad I’ll tell you, and if I’m horny you should know. </p>
    <p>&emsp; This is what it means to be punk, brutally honest about the worst parts of the world and open with your emotions, because let’s face it, a lot of the world is a shit show. </p>
    <p>So welcome to my blog.</p>
